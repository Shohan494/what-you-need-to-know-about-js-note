## What You Need To Know About JavaScript
###### Collection of key points and notes on this book

#### Some common uses of JavaScript

- If you need to create a contact form where some fields are required, you can
rely on JavaScript to alert the user if he has missed some of these fields and
to validate or sanitize their contents. You don't have to rely on alert windows
anymore as the Document Object Model (DOM) can be accessed through
JavaScript to manipulate its look, content, and attributes.

- You can populate search boxes with common terms as you type into them;
this is a feature known as autocomplete.

- Displaying or hiding information on demand and animating elements on a
page is a walk in the park using JavaScript.

- Using JavaScript, you can pass requests to a backend server and handle
responses without reloading the page.
